## Technical Details

### Push Notification Flow
1. **Service Worker Registration**: App registers a service worker for background functionality
2. **VAPID Keys**: Uses VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) for secure push messaging
3. **Subscription**: Browser creates a unique subscription endpoint
4. **Server Storage**: Subscription is stored on the server
5. **Notification Delivery**: Server sends notifications to all subscribed devices

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Main app interface
- `GET /api/quote` - Get a random quote
- `GET /api/vapid-public-key` - Get VAPID public key for subscriptions
- `POST /api/subscribe` - Subscribe to push notifications
- `POST /api/send-notification` - Send test notification

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working?
1. **Check Browser Support**: Push notifications require Safari 16.4+ on iOS
2. **HTTPS Required**: For production, your site must use HTTPS
3. **Permission Denied**: Clear browser data and try enabling notifications again
4. **Service Worker Issues**: Check browser developer tools for errors

### Can't Install as PWA?
1. **Use Safari**: PWA installation only works in Safari on iOS
2. **HTTPS Required**: PWA features require HTTPS in production
3. **Manifest Issues**: Check that manifest.json is loading correctly

### Development Tips
- **Local Testing**: Use ngrok or similar tools to expose localhost with HTTPS
- **Debug Mode**: Check browser console for detailed error messages
- **Service Worker**: Clear service worker cache during development

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About Usage

**Q: Do I need to keep the app open to receive notifications?**  
A: No! Once you enable notifications, you'll receive them even when the app or browser is closed. That's the magic of push notifications and service workers.

**Q: How often will I get notifications?**  
A: The app is designed to send one inspirational quote per day. The exact timing depends on how the server is configured (some deployments may not have automatic daily notifications set up yet).

**Q: Can I get notifications on my iPhone?**  
A: Yes! iPhone support for web push notifications was added in iOS 16.4. **IMPORTANT**: On iOS, you MUST first install the app to your home screen before notifications will work. Use Safari, tap the Share button (üì§), select "Add to Home Screen", then open the installed app and enable notifications.

**Q: Why don't notifications work on my iPhone even though I enabled them?**  
A: This is the most common issue! iOS requires the app to be installed as a PWA (to home screen) before push notifications will function. If you're using the app in Safari browser without installing it, notifications won't work. Install it to your home screen first, then try enabling notifications again.

**Q: What's the difference between the demo and full version?**  
A: The demo version (GitHub Pages) lets you browse quotes and install as a PWA, but can't send push notifications. The full version (deployed server) includes all features including push notifications.

**Q: Is this app free to use?**  
A: Yes! It's completely free and open source. You can deploy your own copy or use any existing deployment.

### About Technical Stuff

**Q: What's a PWA and why should I install it?**  
A: A Progressive Web App (PWA) works like a native app but runs in your browser. Installing it gives you faster loading, offline access, and a cleaner interface without browser toolbars.

**Q: Is my data private and secure?**  
A: Yes! The app only stores your notification subscription locally in your browser. No personal data is collected or shared. The app is open source so you can verify this yourself.

**Q: Can I use this on Android?**  
A: Absolutely! Android has supported web push notifications for years. Works great in Chrome and other modern browsers.

**Q: Why do I need to allow notifications?**  
A: Browser security requires explicit user permission for notifications. This prevents websites from spamming you. You can revoke permission anytime in your browser settings.

**Q: What happens if I clear my browser data?**  
A: You'll need to enable notifications again, but no big deal! Just click "Enable Notifications" and you're back to receiving daily quotes.

### About Development

**Q: Can I customize the quotes or add my own?**  
A: Yes! Check the `quotes` array in `server.js` or `api/_shared.js`. You can add your own quotes or modify existing ones.

**Q: How do I deploy this to my own server?**  
A: See the [Deployment](#deployment) section above. We provide guides for Vercel, Heroku, Netlify, and other platforms.

**Q: Can I contribute to this project?**  
A: Of course! This is an open source project. Check out the [Contributing](#contributing) section or open an issue with your ideas.
